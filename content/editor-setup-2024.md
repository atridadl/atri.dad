Another quick one folks! I have made huge changes to my setup lately, and wanted to document it here for those who may be looking for something simpler. I like _simple_ software. VSCode and even Zed do _not_ check that box. Zed is riddled with collaboration features I don't need and VSCode is famously cluttered and loves to horde as much RAM as possible. What happened to simple code editors? Nothing!

# It's Sublime Time!
Sublime Text is a gem among the chaotic landscape of editors fighting for space in your HDD/SSD. It is just plain **fast**! I cannot stress enough by how much too! Opening large projects takes no time at all, and scrolling is so incredibly smooth. It doesn't stop there, as the packages are incredible. For instance, the LSP package is so darn fast. I don't seem to have the same crashing issues I had with VSCode in a large TypeScript codebase either!

# Don't you Git it?!
The developers also made an equally performant and clean Git client called Sublime Merge, and its the same story! It is fast, feature rich, and has a clean UI! I've played around with tools like Github Desktop and Kraken, and I keep coming back to Sublime Merge for its simplicity. My favourite feature: every Git action you take in the UI has a corresponding Git command the app _shows you in the UI_. This is huge for learning Git commands, and just for transparency for what the app is doing. And the icing on top? It integrates with Sublime Text.

# Give it a shot!
I whole heartedly recommend giving them a try! The links can be found [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [here](https://www.sublimemerge.com/). Did you try it? Do you enjoy it? Feel free to reach out by email at [me@atri.dad](mailto:me@atri.dad). Until next time! ðŸ«¡
